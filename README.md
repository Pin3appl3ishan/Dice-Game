# Dice Game

This is a simple dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The dice game is a two-player game where each player takes turns to roll a dice and accumulate points. The first player to reach a specified winning score wins the game.

## Game Rules

- The game is played by two players, taking alternating turns.
- On each turn, a player rolls a dice by clicking the "Roll Dice" button.
- The number rolled on the dice gets added to the player's current score.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current score is lost, and it becomes the other player's turn.
- A player can choose to "Hold" their current score, adding it to their total score. Then it becomes the other player's turn.
- The first player to reach the winning score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
- Click the "New Game" button to start a new game.
